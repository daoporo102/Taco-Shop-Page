            <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
            <details>
                <summary>When did tacos first appear in the US?</summary>
                <p>Tacos first appeared in the US around 1905, brought by Mexican migrant workers who introduced them as a portable street food. The first mention of tacos in an American newspaper was in 1905. They were initially a working-class food but became more mainstream as they fused with American ingredients and the invention of the U-shaped, pre-fried hard taco shell in the 1940s, which was a significant step in making them a popular fast food.
